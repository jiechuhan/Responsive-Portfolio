                <img src="assets/images/self.jpg" alt="jiechuhan">
                <p>I am an international student studied at IU major in journalism and math and got my master's degree in journalism at USC. Iâ€™m focusing on broadcast journalism and graphic design. I come from China.</p>
                <p>I love playing guitar and keyboard. When I stay alone, I like to play my guitar, because it can make me feel calm. Pop music is my favorite, and my favorite pop singer is Adam Lambert.</p>
                <p>Traveling is also my hobby. I went to lots of countries before. Fiji, Singapore, Australia, the United Kingdom, and etc. I would like to use my camera photographing all beautiful places.</p>
                <p>I would like to take more coding courses, in order to practice my logical thinking. Coding is fun to me, because it takes time to think, but after having an idea, things go easier.</p>
                <p>Hope I can design more creative projects in my future courses, and gain more skills that I expect.</p>
